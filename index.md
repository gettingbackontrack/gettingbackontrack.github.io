Getting back on track. N0 f@p (I'm allowed to f@p at 9pm everyday since I'm
just building my way up), limiting distraction time (1.5 hr max),
hiking/exercising frequently, eating a proper diet (starting next week, will
attempt this week). If I fail, I have to take a cold shower.

- Streak on n0 f@p before 9pm (for now): 0
- Streak on 1.5 hr distraction time limit: 0
- Weeks I exercised/hiked frequently: 0
- Streak on proper diet (starting next week): 0
